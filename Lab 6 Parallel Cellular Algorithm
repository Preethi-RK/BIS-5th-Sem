Parallel Cellular Algorithm (PCA):

INPUT:
    n = Population size
    Max_iter = Maximum number of iterations
    f(x) = Objective function to optimize
    lb, ub = Lower and upper bounds of the search space

OUTPUT:
    Best solution found during the process

Steps:
1. Initialize population: Randomly create a population of n solutions within the bounds.
2. Divide population into cells: Split the population into subgroups (cells).
3. Cellular evolution: Each cell evolves through local search and interaction with neighboring cells.
4. Parallel evaluation: Evaluate fitness of all solutions in parallel.
5. Selection: Select the best solutions after each iteration.
6. Repeat until stopping criteria (Max_iter or convergence) are met.
7. Return best solution found.
