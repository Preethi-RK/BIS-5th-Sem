Genetic Algorithm (GA)

1. **Initialize Population**:
   - Randomly generate a population of `N` individuals, each represented as a chromosome.

2. **Evaluate Fitness**:
   - Calculate the fitness value for each individual in the population using the given objective function.

3. **Selection**:
   - Select individuals based on their fitness using techniques such as roulette wheel selection, tournament selection, or rank selection.
   - Choose parents for crossover based on their probability of selection.

4. **Crossover (Recombination)**:
   - Select pairs of parents and exchange parts of their chromosomes to produce offspring.
   - Use crossover techniques such as single-point, two-point, or uniform crossover.

5. **Mutation**:
   - Introduce random changes to the offspring's chromosomes with a small probability (mutation rate).
   - This helps maintain genetic diversity in the population.

6. **Form New Generation**:
   - Replace the old population with the new offspring population.
   - Optionally, retain the best individual from the previous generation (elitism).

7. **Check Stopping Criteria**:
   - Repeat steps 2â€“6 until a stopping condition is met (e.g., maximum number of generations or acceptable fitness value).

8. **Output Solution**:
   - Return the individual with the best fitness value as the optimal solution.
