Gene Expression Programming (GEP):

INPUT:
    n = Population size
    Max_iter = Maximum number of iterations
    f(x) = Objective function to optimize
    lb, ub = Lower and upper bounds of the search space

OUTPUT:
    Best solution found during the process

Steps:
1. Initialize population: Create an initial population of programs (individuals) represented by expression trees.
2. Evaluate fitness: Evaluate the fitness of each individual program using the objective function.
3. Selection: Select individuals based on their fitness for reproduction.
4. Crossover and mutation: Apply genetic operators (crossover and mutation) to produce new programs.
5. Repeat until stopping criteria (Max_iter or convergence) are met.
6. Return best solution found.
