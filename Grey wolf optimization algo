Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) Algorithm
INPUT:

n = number of wolves (population size)

Max_iter = maximum number of iterations

f(x) = objective function to be optimized

lb,ub = lower and upper bounds of the search space
OUTPUT:

Best solution found by the algorithm
Steps:
1) Initialize positions of n wolves randomly within the search space.
2) Evaluate fitness of each wolf using the objective function.
3) Sort wolves based on fitness to identify alpha,beta nad delta wolves (best, second best, and third best).
4) Update positions of wolves using the following formula:
X_i_new = X_α - A ⋅ D_α
X_i_new = X_β - B ⋅ D_β
X_i_new = X_δ - C ⋅ D_δ​

where 
𝐴
A, 𝐵 and 𝐶 are coefficient vectors, and 
𝐷𝛼, D𝛽, D𝛿 are the distances from the wolves.
5) Convergence check: Repeat until maximum iterations or stopping criterion is met.
6) Return best solution found.
